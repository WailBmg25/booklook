# BookLook Product Overview

BookLook is a big data application for book management and discovery. It's a comprehensive book library system that allows users to:

- Browse and search books with detailed metadata (title, ISBN, publication date, description, etc.)
- Manage authors and genres with many-to-many relationships
- Create user accounts and maintain favorite book lists
- Write and read book reviews with ratings (1-5 stars)
- Support for both authenticated and anonymous reviews

The system is designed as a REST API backend with PostgreSQL for data persistence and Redis for caching, supporting book discovery and social features around reading recommendations.
